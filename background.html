                    <p class="lead">Computer vision is the application of computational algorithms to recognize images in order for computers to understand and manipulate them. This allows computers to gain high-level understanding of digital images, as well as allowing them to use this understanding for tasks such as handwriting recognition, facial recognition, and motion estimation. The field first began taking form in the 1960s with the rise in the search for artificial intelligence and methods for machine learning. It was thought that through image analysis and full scene deconstruction, one could model the human visual system and adequately recreate the capabilities of the human eye and visual cortex.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Algorithms for line and edge recognition developed quickly, but true full scene reconstruction and high-level understanding eluded computer scientists until the application of machine learning techniques in the field of computer vision much more recently. Machine learning is the practice of equipping computers with the capabilities to learn in the same manner as humans do, and in that way to achieve true artificial intelligence. Learning machines arose primarily for specific purposes at first, such as a machine that learns how to program from observing human programmers.</p>
                    <p class="lead">An incredibly powerful method of machine learning are neural network systems. These systems loosely attempt to model the ability of the human brain to learn via large numbers of artificial neurons connected to others, with the ability to learn and adapt based on raw data and examples of correctly interpreted data. A convolutional neural network is a form of feed forward neural network that attempts to model biological visual systems, making it a perfect candidate for application to computer vision.</p>

                                <br/>This paper introduces the LeNet 5, an extension off of the traditional convolutional neural network. Here it was applied to the visual recognition of written characters. The efficacy of this network spurred further development of computer vision techniques and ultimately spawned the convolutional neural network we know today.

The ability for all processes in the future to be fully automated is an empowering idea and will be accomplished through the use of artificial intelligence. Applications for this technology range from self-driving cars, surveillance, to speech modeling.
