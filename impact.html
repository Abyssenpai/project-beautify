                    <p class="lead pad">To forecast our potenntial impact on the workforce and market, we looked at three factors. The first was the size of the market. Our market is ameteur photographers, a demographic that can include anyone with a smartphone. Next, we looked at the competition we stand to face. Currently, the largest player in the mobile photo editing market (and the photo editing market at large) is Adobe. They estimate the mobile photgraphy market to be worth $1.6 Billion. Finallay, we figured out how much of that market we can hope to capture. Setting a 10% marketshare as our 5-year target, and planning for 30% growth per year, we can aim to capture 3.5% of the market during year one, which is worth around $56M.</p>

Their Bachelor of Science in Computer Science requires a heavy systemic and theoretical computer science course load in addition to a core scientific background. They also offer courses in cognitive psychology which is important for understanding human intelligence. As the computer science major is part of the college for engineering, it provides access to the engineering courses required to create a practical system as opposed to merely the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning. This provides the tools and knowledge for those wishing to pursue a career in developing the types of artificial cognition that our product utilizes.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Carnegie Mellon University (www.ece.cmu.edu) enjoys a highly distinguished electrical engineering and computer science program. They offer a Masters in Software Engineering degree which provides the graduate student with knowledge in the construction of highly advanced software systems, such as artificial intelligence and new machine learning techniques. Their courses in statistical discovery and learning are of particular interest to those pursuing machine leit involves the handling and usage of huge databases. Their strategic location in the middle of silicon valley allows for graduate students to complete their degree while also accumulating real world experience through work-study programs and internships with huge corporations involved with cutting edge research into artificial intelligence and machine learning. The M.S. in Software Engineering is offered through the college of engineering and the electrical engineering and computer science department.

                     <br/>Robot-Human Interactions 101: creating rewarding and synergistic pathways for AI functionality” - As computers gain further abilities to “see” and “do”, the need for both technological and ethical management of their interactions with humans must be researched and tested. What can robots learn from observing humans, and how can this process be administered safely? This degree would combine not only AI and graphics, but also cognitive psychology, education, and interaction design.</p>
